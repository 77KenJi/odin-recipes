        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package of phyllo dough (16 oz), thawed</li>
            <li>2 cups of mixed nuts (walnuts, pistachios, or almonds), finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup of unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>For the Syrup:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Brush the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with melted butter.</li>
            <li>Place one sheet of phyllo dough in the dish and brush with more melted butter. Repeat this process, layering and buttering each sheet (about 8-10 sheets in total).</li>
            <li>Mix chopped nuts and ground cinnamon, then spread a thin layer of the nut mixture over the dough.</li>
            <li>Continue layering phyllo dough (buttering each sheet) until about half of the dough is used. Spread another layer of nuts. Finish layering the remaining phyllo dough.</li>
            <li>Cut the baklava into squares or diamond shapes with a sharp knife before baking.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes or until the top is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Prepare the syrup by boiling sugar, water, lemon juice, and cinnamon stick. Let it simmer for 10 minutes, then remove the cinnamon stick.</li>
            <li>Once the baklava is out of the oven, pour the hot syrup over it and let it cool for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Cut and serve once cooled.</li>
        </ol>
